### üåê Live Demo

The webshop is deployed on [Render.com](https://render.com) and accessible at the following link:

[https://webshop-frontend-wl0h.onrender.com](https://webshop-frontend-wl0h.onrender.com)

> **Note:**  
> The first load may take **up to 30‚Äì60 seconds**, especially if the app hasn‚Äôt been accessed in a while.  
> This delay is due to [Render's free tier](https://render.com/docs/free#spin-down), which **automatically spins down inactive services** to save resources. When you revisit the site, it needs to "wake up" the backend and frontend containers before responding.
<br />

## About the Project

This project is a **work in progress** full-stack webshop built for a real deployment scenario.  
Once completed, it will include product management, authentication, and a responsive user interface ‚Äî providing a real-world e-commerce experience.

## Getting Started

You can either check out the **[üåê Live Demo](#-live-demo)** above  
**or** run the project locally by following these steps:

### Prerequisites

This project uses **Docker** for containerized development. To install everything you need, just download `Docker Desktop`:

  - Docker Desktop
    ‚û°Ô∏è https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

### Installation Steps

1. Open a **terminal** and navigate to the directory where you would like to save the repository.
   
2. **Clone the repository** to your machine by executing these commands in your **terminal**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/o-k-e/ganesha-webshop.git
    cd ganesha-webshop
    ```
   
3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   - To set up your environment variables, copy and rename the .env.example file to .env in the root directory by running the following terminal command:
      - On macOS / Linux:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```

        - On Windows (PowerShell):
        ```bash
        copy .env.example .env
        ```
    - Once copied, you can open the .env file and replace `your_username`, `your_password` with your actual credentials.
      For example:
  
        ```env
        DATABASE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/ganesha_webshop
        DATABASE_USERNAME=postgres
        DATABASE_PASSWORD=postgres
        JWT_SECRET=uH38!v4zP#cE1sM@9rT$wX2qL*kbZ7oN
        JWT_EXPIRATION=8640000
        ```
        
      ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**  
      The `.env` file contains sensitive information (such as database credentials and JWT secrets) and should **never be exposed** in a real production environment. 
      This setup is acceptable **only for local development** or **learning purposes**.  In a production setup, use secure environment variable management tools or secret vaults.

4. **Ensure Docker is Running**
   - Start `Docker Desktop`
     
5. **Build and run the containers**
   - Execute the command in the `backend` folder:
     ```bash
     docker compose up --build
     ```

6. **Access the Application**
   - Open your browser and visit: [http://localhost](http://localhost)
  
7. **Stopping the application**
    
- In your **terminal** press `Ctrl + C`
- If you want to **stop and remove the containers**, but **keep the database data** for future runs, execute:
  ```bash
  docker compose down
  ```
  In this case, the database will **persist** between runs, and your data will still be available next time you start the application.

- If you want to **stop, remove the containers and delete the database data**, execute:
  ```bash
  docker compose down -v
  ```
  In this case, the database and all stored data will be completely removed.
